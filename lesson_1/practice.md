# In your own words, what does encapsulation refer to in JavaScript?
Encapsulation refers to the idea of bringing all the data and actions needed for a particular object within that object, so that it is self contained.

# In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?
In JS, encapsulation is a little different in that it is more difficult to restrict access to the "contents" of an object. Other languages are often better at restricting the 'public access' of the data or actions within an object.
